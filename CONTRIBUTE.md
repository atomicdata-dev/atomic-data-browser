## Publishing

- Check the [changelog](changelog.md), make sure the headers are correct
- `yarn lint-fix`
- `yarn build` to build typescript files (don't skip this!)
- `yarn test` (don't you publish a broken build!), make sure `atomic-server` is running on `localhost`.
- commit any changes
- `yarn publish`
  - Choose a new version. Versions should match `atomic-data-rs`.
  - This updates the `package.json` files, creates a commit, tags it, pushes it to github, and publishes the builds to npm.

## Understanding vite and yarn workspaces

This monorepo is orchestrated with yarn (v2) workspaces.
Yarn workspaces are used to share dependencies.

Vite hosts the data-browser and targets `.ts` files which enables hot reload / hot module replacement, which is great for developing the data browser and the libraries at the same time.

## Iterative builds

If you're editing `@tomic/lib` or `@tomic/react`, you need to re-build the library, as `atomic-data-browser` imports the `.js` files.
You can auto re-build using the `watch` commands in `@tomic/lib` and `@tomic/react`.
If you run `yarn start` from the root, these will be run automatically.
Note that you may need to refresh your screen manually to show updates from these libraries.

There are two possible solutions for improving this workflow:

- In `package.json` of the libraries, set the `main` to `src/index.ts` (the typescript file). However, make sure to _not_ publish this to npm, as many clients will fail.
- Properly set up aliases with vite. I've tried this before, but failed.
